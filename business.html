    <h1>My Business</h1>
    <p>I would love to start a business. 
        "Does this business do anything?" you might ask. 
        At this point, no. 
        I don't know the purpose of this business, because I have only thought of it for this assignment. 
        Owning a business might be cool, though; I guess I should get thinking.
    </p>
    <p>This second paragraph only exists to show that I am a functional human being who knows how to insert two paragraphs into an HTML document. 
        Aren't you so proud of my accomplishments? 
        Maybe I'm so good at coding, I could hack into everything and own 
        <i>all</i>
        of the businesses. 
        That would be pretty cool. 
        I might have to learn a little bit more about coding first, though. 
        Basic HTML won't get me anywhere in my plans to hack into "everything."
